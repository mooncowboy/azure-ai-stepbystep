[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/mooncowboy/ai-zerotohero)

Hands on labs originally created for the Step by Step for partners motion in Portugal and now available for everyone.

While there are many official quickstarts and tutorials available, these labs are intented to provide a more hands-on experience with Azure AI Studio and Azure OpenAI services, in a step by step fashion, easy to follow and with a focus on the most common scenarios.

They are intented as a quickstart to see Azure AI in action. It is strongly encouraged to read the official documentation and browse official quickstarts and tutorials, some of which you can find at the end of this page.
